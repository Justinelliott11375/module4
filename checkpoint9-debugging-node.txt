Code Challenge

I used the node debugger tool to watch the index.js file from the terminal commands checkpoint walk through the code. It was very interesting to see how it accesses the other modules, reads the directory, executes the callback, etc. I could even see the code that checks to see if the callback is a function and throws an error if it is not, which was pretty cool. It really shows the power that this tool has over a simple console.log.
